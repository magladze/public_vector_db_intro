## Introduction to Vector Databases

### What are Vector Databases?

Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store, retrieve, and manipulate high-dimensional vectors efficiently. These vectors are often used to represent complex data types such as text, images, and other forms of unstructured data. The primary advantage of vector databases is their ability to perform rapid similarity searches, which is crucial for tasks such as semantic search, recommendation systems, and more.

### History of Vector Databases

The concept of vector databases has been around for several years, but it has gained significant traction in recent times due to the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Traditional databases are not well-suited for handling high-dimensional data, which led to the development of specialized vector databases. These databases leverage advanced indexing techniques like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) graphs and other proximity algorithms to provide efficient and scalable search capabilities.

## Introduction to ChromaDB

### What is ChromaDB?

ChromaDB is a modern vector database designed to handle high-dimensional data efficiently. It leverages state-of-the-art algorithms to provide fast and accurate similarity searches. ChromaDB is built with a focus on ease of use, scalability, and integration with popular machine learning frameworks.

### History of ChromaDB

ChromaDB was developed to address the growing need for efficient vector search capabilities in various applications. Its development was driven by the limitations of traditional databases in handling high-dimensional vectors, along with the increasing demand for real-time, scalable solutions in the AI and ML space.

### What Makes ChromaDB Different?

### Alternatives to ChromaDB

Some alternatives to ChromaDB include:

- **Faiss** (Facebook AI Similarity Search): A library developed by Facebook for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- **Annoy** (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): Developed by Spotify for fast nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces.
- **Milvus**: An open-source vector database built for AI applications, offering high performance and scalability.

## Code Explanation

The provided code demonstrates how to use ChromaDB for creating and managing a vector database, performing semantic search, and adding categories and subcategories. Below is a detailed explanation of the code:

### Imports and Setup

```python
import chromadb
import json
import os
import chromadb.utils.embedding_functions as embedding_functions
```

- `chromadb`: The main library for interacting with ChromaDB.
- `json` and `os`: Standard Python libraries for JSON manipulation and environment variable access.
- `embedding_functions`: Utility functions for embedding generation.

### Embedding Function Setup

```python
embedding_func = embedding_functions.OpenAIEmbeddingFunction(
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    model_name="text-embedding-3-small"
)
```

- `OpenAIEmbeddingFunction`: Uses OpenAI's API to generate embeddings for text data.

### Configuration Flags

```python
add = False
delete_collection = False
```

- `add`: Flag to determine whether to add categories and subcategories to the collection.
- `delete_collection`: Flag to determine whether to delete the existing collection.

### ChromaDB Client Initialization

```python
chroma_client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path="./chroma_data")
```

- `PersistentClient`: Initializes a persistent ChromaDB client, storing data at the specified path.

### Collection Management

```python
if delete_collection:
    chroma_client.delete_collection('categories_collection')
```

- Deletes the specified collection if the `delete_collection` flag is set.

```python
collection_name = 'categories_collection'
collections_now_in_db = [i.name for i in chroma_client.list_collections()]

if collection_name not in collections_now_in_db:
    collection = chroma_client.create_collection(name=collection_name, embedding_function=embedding_func)
else:
    collection = chroma_client.get_collection(name=collection_name, embedding_function=embedding_func)
```

- Checks if the collection exists and creates or retrieves it accordingly.

### Categories Data

```python
categories_data = {
    "Electronics": ["Smartphones", "Laptops", "Tablets"],
    "Home Appliances": ["Refrigerators", "Microwaves", "Washing Machines"],
    "Books": ["Fiction", "Non-Fiction", "Children's Books"]
}
```

- Defines example categories and subcategories.

### Adding Categories and Subcategories

```python
def add_categories_to_collection(categories_data, collection):
    for category, subcategories in categories_data.items():
        collection.add(documents=[category], metadatas=[{"type": "category"}], ids=[category])
        for subcategory in subcategories:
            collection.add(documents=[subcategory], metadatas=[{"type": "subcategory", "parent_category": category}], ids=[f"{category}::{subcategory}"])
```

- Function to add categories and subcategories to the collection.

```python
if add:
    add_categories_to_collection(categories_data, collection)
```

- Adds the categories and subcategories if the `add` flag is set.

### Semantic Search Function

```python
def semantic_search(query, collection, top_k=5):
    query_embedding = embedding_func.embed_with_retries([query])[0]
    category_results = collection.query(query_embeddings=[query_embedding], n_results=top_k, where={"type": "category"})
    if not category_results['documents']:
        return {"categories": [], "subcategories": []}
    best_category = category_results['documents'][0][0]
    subcategory_results = collection.query(query_embeddings=[query_embedding], n_results=top_k, where={"$and": [{"type": "subcategory"}, {"parent_category": best_category}]})
    best_subcategory = subcategory_results['documents'][0][0]
    return {"categories": best_category, "subcategories": best_subcategory}
```

- Function to perform semantic search and return the best matching category and subcategory.

### Running Semantic Search

```python
query = "star wars"
results = semantic_search(query, collection)
print(json.dumps(results, indent=2))
```

- Performs a semantic search with the query "aftershave" and prints the results.

## Use Cases

This code and functionality can be used for:

- **E-commerce**: Organizing and searching product categories and subcategories.
- **Content Management**: Categorizing and retrieving articles, documents, or media files based on semantic similarity.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Providing recommendations based on user queries and preferences.
- **Customer Support**: Categorizing support tickets and providing relevant solutions.

## Further Exploration

To extend this functionality, you can:

- **Add More Data**: Include more categories, subcategories, and documents to the collection.
- **Improve Embeddings**: Experiment with different embedding models to improve search accuracy.
- **Real-time Updates**: Implement real-time data updates and searches.
- **Integration**: Integrate this functionality into a web application or API for broader use.
